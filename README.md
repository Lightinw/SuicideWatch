🧠 Model Info - Our Digital Shrink
Training Data:

10k+ text samples

Classified by humans who definitely needed therapy afterward

Balanced with cat memes to prevent developer burnout 😼

Accuracy:

92% at detecting suicidal intent

100% at judging your questionable life choices

    return HIGH_RISK
elif "Monday" in text:
    return MODERATE_RISK  # Understandable
⚠️ Critical Disclaimer - Read This or the Robot Cries
THIS IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL
Our AI has the emotional depth of a toaster. If it flags your text:

✅ Validates you might need help

❌ Cannot replace actual human professionals
